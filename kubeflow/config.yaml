# This config file specifies which Kubeflow components to deploy.
# Each line has a relative path from this folder to manifests of a component to
# deploy.

## Component dependencies
# Each component may have a comment like: `dependencies: [ xxx ]`
# It means this component depends on listed components.
# Note, that the information may not be fully accurate at the moment. Welcome
# feedback if you find any mistakes.

## Select a subset of components
# You can delete/comment components to selectively pick the components you want
# to deploy.

## Customize a component
# Edit or overlay manifests of that component.

## Order of components
# The ordering of this list matters. When deploying, the components are
# deployed in the same order as this file.
