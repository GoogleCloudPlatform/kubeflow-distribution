## Instruction for Kubeflow Cluster

This instruction is for the deployment steps to create Kubeflow Cluster on GCP. This instruction assumes that you have already created [Management Cluster](../management/README.md) for creating Google Cloud related resources. And have [authorized Config Connector](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/distributions/gke/deploy/management-setup/#authorize-cloud-config-connector-for-each-managed-project) to manage Kubeflow project.

### Prerequisite

Install the necessary tools if not already.

1. Install gcloud SDK and deployment tools:

```bash
gcloud components install kubectl kpt beta
gcloud components update
```

2. Install Kustomize:

```bash
# Detect your OS and download corresponding latest Kustomize binary
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/master/hack/install_kustomize.sh"  | bash

# Add the kustomize package to your $PATH env variable
sudo mv ./kustomize /usr/local/bin/kustomize
```

3. Install yq v3

Follow the yq v3 [installation instruction](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install). For example, if using wget, you can run following commands: 

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/3.4.1/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/bin/yq && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/yq
```

4. Install jq https://stedolan.github.io/jq/, for example, we can run the following command on Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install jq
```

### Fetch packages

Go to Kubeflow Cluster

```bash
cd kubeflow
```

`kubeflow/gcp-blueprints` utilizes upstream repositority `kubeflow/manifests` for versioned manifests of multiple Kubeflow components. We need to first fetch upstream manifests by running command:

```bash
bash ./pull_upstream.sh
```

### Environment Variables

Provide actual value for the following variables in `env.sh`, refer to detailed
documentation in env.sh.

Set the environment variables in your shell:

```bash
source env.sh
```

Configure kpt setters as environement variables in packages:

```bash
bash kpt-set.sh
```

Set the Client ID and Secret from IAP OAuth step:

```bash
export CLIENT_ID=<Your CLIENT_ID>
export CLIENT_SECRET=<Your CLIENT_SECRET>
```

### Deploy Kubeflow Cluster


Run following command to login:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

Set the google project you want to deploy.
```bash
gcloud config set project $KF_PROJECT
```

Deploy Kubeflow cluster, required Google Cloud resources and all Kubeflow components:

```bash
make apply
```

## Other Commands

Reminder, all the following commands assume you already set up env vars by:

```bash
source env.sh
```

### Hydrate all manifests but not apply them

If you want to check the resources in `build` directories first, run the
following command before `make apply`:

```bash
make hydrate
```

### Clean up the hydration result from all components

After hydration or apply, you will have `build` folder in each component for manifest yaml files. If you want to clean them up, you can run:

```bash
make clean-build
```

### Uninstall the whole Kubeflow cluster

Deleting cluster itself doesn't necessarily remove all resources created by this instruction. You can run the following command to clean them up:

```bash
make delete
```

#### Delete managed storage

Managed storage -- CloudSQL and Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket contains Kubeflow
Pipelines data, they are not deleted by default when deleting the Kubeflow
cluster, because you can re-deploy a new Kubeflow cluster using existing managed
storages.

Run the following commands to delete managed storage:

```bash
cd common/managed-storage
make delete
```

### Working with individual components

The Makefile helps you apply all components in one batch, but you can apply
each component individually too. It has the same effect as doing it in one batch.

Before you start, confirm:

* You've ran above commands in Kubeflow root folder:

    ```bash
    source ./env.sh
    bash ./pull_upstream.sh
    bash ./kpt-set.sh
    ```
* You've deployed all required components and dependencies of the component you
choose.

Then for example, if you have a component at `apps/pipelines`, visit the component
folder:

```bash
cd apps/pipelines
ls Makefile
```

If there's a Makefile, you can:

* apply by `make apply`
* hydrate by `make hydrate`
* delete by `make delete`

There may be other commands supported depending on the component, you can read
the README.md or the Makefile to learn more.

If not, you can:

* apply by `kustomize build . | kubectl --context "${KF_NAME}" apply -f -`
* hydrate by `mkdir -p build && kustomize build . -o ./build/`
* delete by `kustomize build . | kubectl --context "${KF_NAME}" delete -f -`
