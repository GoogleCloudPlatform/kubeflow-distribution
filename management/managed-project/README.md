A simplepackage to grant ownership permissions on a project to
the GCP service account you are running CNRM with.

The Google Cloud Project where you install Config Connector is known as the host project, or **HOST_PROJECT**. The other projects where you manage resources are known as the managed projects, or **MANAGED_PROJECT**. These could be the same project if you only intend to use Config Connector to create Google Cloud resources in the same project as your cluster.
